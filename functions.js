//functions are a block of code that perform a particular action 
 function sumofNums(a,b){
    let sum = a+b;
    return sum;
    
 }

 //So function can be used to perform lots of actions in javascipt. they can be used for computation and Api calls and even much more complex stuff

console.log(sumofNums(9,10))
